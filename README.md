#Construction Text Classifier (Hackathon Project)

This project was a product of the 2019 Procore Hackathon. The idea was more for solo exploration into neural networks, but the use cases are endless. If we can start identifying what people are talking about within procore, we can start creating connecitons with other vendors, identify potential puchase intents, or simply provide more insights to GCs on their projects (ex: 85% of project delays/rfi's were linked to Concrete and Masonry work)

Unfortunately I was unable to get good training data for this experiement (turns out our db is filled with test/demo/orientation/foobar dummy accounts that mucked up the data pool a lot). You'll notice most of what I did was from data I accumulated by hand. Most of the text I'll be handling in this process will be common questions brought up from RFIs and Submittals
